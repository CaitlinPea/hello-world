Starting a new quest: learning code.
About me: I'm creative and curious, always aiming to learn. I like reading, writing, editing, napping. I never knowo what to say about myself - espcially when I don't know who might read it. If you're reading this, I'm probably willing to be friends. What kind of cookies do you like?
